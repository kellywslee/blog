      <p>I&apos;m Kelly, a full stack developer based in Toronto, Canada.</p>
      <p>
        With a fresh perspective as a recent graduate from York University
        Full-Stack Web Development program, my journey in tech was preceded by
        enriching experiences as a program coordinator helping vulnerable
        populations in Canada and as a tutor in math and physics. These roles
        have shaped my approach to development, focusing on crafting accessible
        and user-friendly applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to make technology inclusive and available to all, blending
        creativity, curiosity, and a strong enthusiasm for technology in every
        project I undertake.
